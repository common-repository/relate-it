Relate-it is a very simple plugin that shows thumbnails of posts related to the blog entry, based on the same tag or category.

== Description ==

If you have a bounce rate problem or your readers don't stay too long on your web, Relate-it can help. It shows thumbnails of
related posts as an alternative to link lists or tags.  

The thumbnails will appear between the content of the post and the comments section.

The relationship between the posts is established based on two criteria: same tag or category.
First the plugin looks for posts wiht the same tags as the main post. If the number of obtained posts doesn't reach a value
specified in the plugin settings section then it looks for posts in the same category. Finally, to complete the number of
related posts, it uses random posts.
